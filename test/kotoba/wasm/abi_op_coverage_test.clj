(ns kotoba.wasm.abi-op-coverage-test
  "Every kotoba:dom op must be known to ALL THREE layers that see it:
   `abi/op->record` (encode), `abi/validate-batch` (admit), and
   `kotoba.wasm.host.retained/apply-op` (apply).

   This test exists because they drifted, twice, and both drifts were
   invisible until a real page hit them:

   - `:append-content` (CSS generated content, ::before/::after) and
     `:create-comment` were encoded and applied but NOT admitted, so
     `validate-batch` threw \"Invalid ABI op kind\" and took down the
     WHOLE commit batch -- every unrelated mutation queued alongside it
     too. Measured 2026-08-29 through `kotoba-lang/browser`'s two real
     `browser.demo` smoke tests, which had been failing with
     `{:op :append-content}`.
   - Before that, `:remove-event-listener` plus four more ops were
     encoded but not applied, and `apply-op`'s default branch returns
     `state` UNCHANGED -- a silent no-op, so the retained tree simply
     stopped mirroring the guest's DOM with no error anywhere.

   The second shape is why this test pins the no-op set explicitly
   rather than only checking that nothing throws: an op that falls
   through `apply-op`'s default looks exactly like an op that correctly
   has no retained effect."
