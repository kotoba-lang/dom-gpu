  ;; The `<button>`'s `:font-size` in this golden moved 13 -> 13.3333 on
  ;; 2026-08-05, and it is the only value in it that did. It is not a
  ;; rendering change here: cssom.layout's UA control font was always the
  ;; browser's 13.3333px Arial and was TRUNCATED to 13 on purpose, because
  ;; that truncation cancelled an opposite error in the intrinsic WIDTH
  ;; model (see its own ua-control-font). Both halves moved together once
  ;; the missing metric -- the font's average character advance -- turned
  ;; out to be measurable; the width half arrives here through the new
  ;; `:avg-advance`/`:max-advance` hooks the WebGL and WebGPU hosts now
  ;; supply. This golden is built with no host hooks at all, so it sees
  ;; only the size.
  ;;
  ;; 2026-08-06: four KEYS appeared and no number moved -- `:break-inside`,
  ;; `:orphans` and `:frag/insets` on each `:node` op, `:line/h` on the
  ;; `:text` op. cssom.layout grew block fragmentation across a
  ;; multi-column boundary, and all four are what its break-opportunity
  ;; model reads: where a break is forbidden (`break-inside: avoid`,
  ;; `orphans`), where a box's decoration bands end (the free band a cut
  ;; may land in is the CONTENT box, not the border box), and how tall a
  ;; line box is (a text op's own `:y` is the line top on one code path
  ;; and a baseline-derived glyph top on another, and only the emitter
  ;; knows which). Every x/y/w/h in the file is unchanged, which is why it
  ;; was regenerated rather than the comparison relaxed: a golden that
  ;; pins whole op MAPS is how an additive change to the op vocabulary
  ;; becomes visible to this repo at all, and it worked.
